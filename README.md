# Hypera

###  ***All app media (backgrounds, details, etc.) are custom-made by me in Aseprite, Canvas and Adobe Illustrator! No external media was used!***

## Description

#### Hypera is a Social Network, similar to the likes of Instagran or Facebook, made in Java, with extra detailing in CSS. 
The app is only availabe offline, with only one instance running at a time, but provides a fully functioning interface!

## Frameworks used
It uses JavaFX for the graphic design and PostgreSql for the app database.

## How to install
If one may desire to get Hypera up and running on their PC, I've included an sql script, "script.sql", for generating the required database. Also, you may need to toy around with a module-info.java and Gradle files if you want to make it work!

Gradle command : gradle wrapper --gradle-version 3.3 .
